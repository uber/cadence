Generate a random schedule for testing behavior.

Schedules look like:

	[r _ a w _ _ _ _ _ w]
	[_ c _ _ _ _ w _ _ _]

Which means that the first round will:
  - reserve()
  - do nothing
  - allow()
  - wait() (may extend to next event, so the next one is always "_")
  - ...

By the end of that first array it'll reach the end of the `rate.Every` time, and
may recover tokens during the next round's runtime.  So the second round will:
  - do nothing, just refresh .1 while waiting ==> will have 1.0 tokens regenerated
    since the test began, as it was reserved earlier (if non-zero burst).
    (this could be immediately consumed by last round's final wait)
  - reserve but cancel, restoring the token (if any), and maybe refresh .1 token
  - do nothing, maybe refresh .1 more token...
  - ... and try to wait on the 7th event.

Non-blank events do not overlap between rounds to avoid triggering a race
between the old consumed tokens being refreshed and a new call consuming them,
as these make for very flaky tests unless time is mocked.
