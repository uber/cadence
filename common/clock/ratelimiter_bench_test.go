/*
Benchmark data can be seen in the testdata folder, for relevant machines.

Interpretation:
  - for essentially all operations, mostly regardless of sequential / parallel / how parallel,
    the added latency is ~50%, and even extremes are less than double.
    this seems entirely tolerable and safe to use.
  - "reserve and cancel" sequentially is actually *faster* with the wrapper, probably due to fewer time advancements.
    with parallel usage, real vs wrapper is basically a tie.
  - mock-time ratelimiter is faster than real-time in essentially all cases, as you would hope.
    though not by much, unless waiting was part of the test.
  - real *rate.Limiter instances have some pathological behavior that... might disqualify them from safe use tbh.
    essentially this summarizes as "time.Now() is not globally monotonic", and it can lead to significant over and under limiting.

The real *rate.Limiter instances show these quirks during parallel tests, due to time rewinding and jumping forward repeatedly
from the *rate.Limiter's point of view (as it has an internal last-Now value protected by a mutex):
 1. `Allow()`-like calls (both literally `Allow()`, and `Reserve()` followed by sometimes `reservation.Cancel()`)
    can allow both significantly more or significantly fewer calls than they should.
 2. `Wait()` can allow calls through at a faster rate than it should.  At peak, a bit over 2x.
    (and probably slower, but sleeping is not guaranteed to wake up at a precise time so would still be correct behavior)

Essentially, when one call sets the time to "now", and an out-of-sync call sets it to "now-1ms" (time is acquired outside
the limiter's lock, and they may make progress out of order), a token may be restored when a time-consistent limiter would
not do so.

You can recreate this by hand by feeding a ratelimiter "now" and "now+1s" (>=2x the limit) randomly, and watching what it
allows / what the value of Tokens() is as time passes.  Doing this *literally* by hand reproduces it, e.g. pressing enter
on a command-line loop that does this - high frequency is not necessary, just illogical "time travel" outside tight bounds.

The first can be seen in m1_mac_go1.21.txt by comparing these tests:
  - BenchmarkLimiter/allow/parallel/real-4 (note the near-1µs time per allow, which serial calls match)
  - BenchmarkLimiter/allow/parallel/real-8 (time-per-allow is now 231ns, over 4x more allowed than it should)
  - BenchmarkLimiter/reserve-canceling-every-3/parallel/real-2 (1.5ms per allow, around 1,000x fewer allowed than it should)
  - BenchmarkLimiter/reserve-canceling-every-3/parallel/real-8 (450ns per allow, around 2x more than it should)

"real with pinned time" behaves similarly, for similar reasons: canceling can time-travel.
pinned time does make the behavior when called on a single goroutine roughly perfect though.

And the second can be seen in m1_mac_go1.21.txt by comparing these tests:
  - BenchmarkLimiter/wait/parallel/1µs_rate/real (almost exactly 1µs per iteration)
  - BenchmarkLimiter/wait/parallel/1µs_rate/real-8 (~500ns, twice as fast as it should allow)

I have not tried to verify Wait's cause by hand, but it certainly seems like time-thrashing explains it as well.
This is also supported by the wrapper's time-locking *completely* eliminating this flaw, as all iterations take
almost exactly 1µs as they should.

---

All machines I've tried it on behave similarly, though whether one parallel test triggers misbehavior or not
is fairly random.  Higher parallelism triggers it more, and it seems *fairly* likely that at least one misbehaves
in a full `-cpu 1,2,4,8,...[>=cores]` suite, and sometimes many more.
