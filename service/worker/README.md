Cadence Worker
==============

Cadence Worker is a new role for Cadence service used for hosting any
components responsible for performing background processing on the Cadence
cluster.

Replicator
----------

Replicator is a background worker responsible for consuming replication tasks
generated by remote Cadence clusters and pass it down to processor so they
can be applied to local Cadence cluster.

Quickstart for local development with multiple Cadence clusters and replication
====================================
1. Start dependency using docker if you don't have one running:
```
docker-compose -f docker/dev/cassandra.yml up
```
Then install the schemas:
```
make install-schema-cdc
```

2. Start Cadence development server for cluster0, cluster1 and cluster2:
```
./cadence-server --zone xdc_cluster0 start
./cadence-server --zone xdc_cluster1 start
./cadence-server --zone xdc_cluster2 start
```

3. Create a global Cadence domain that replicates data across clusters
```
cadence --do sample domain register --ac cluster0 --cl cluster0 cluster1 cluster2
```
Then run a helloworld from [Go Client Sample](https://github.com/uber-common/cadence-samples/) or [Java Client Sample](https://github.com/uber/cadence-java-samples)

4. Failover a domain between clusters:

Failover to cluster1:
```
cadence --do samples-domain domain update --ac cluster1
```
or failover to cluster2:
   ```
   cadence --do samples-domain domain update --ac cluster2
   ```
Failback to cluster0:
```
cadence --do sample samples-domain update --ac cluster0
```

Archiver
--------

Archiver is used to handle archival of workflow execution histories. It does this by hosting a cadence client worker
and running an archival system workflow. The archival client gets used to initiate archival through signal sending. The archiver
shards work across several workflows.
