Quickstart for development with local Cadence server 
====================================

**Prerequisite**: [Docker + Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) 

Following steps will bring up the docker container running cadence server
along with all its dependencies (cassandra, prometheus, grafana). Exposes cadence
frontend on ports 7933 (tchannel) / 7833 (grpc), web on port 8088, and grafana on port 3000.

```
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/uber/cadence/docker
docker-compose up
```
> Note: Above command will run with `master-auto-setup` image, which is a changing image all the time.
> You can use a released image if you want a stable version. See the below section of "Using a released image".

To update your `master-auto-setup` image to the latest version
```
docker pull ubercadence/server:master-auto-setup

```

* View Cadence-Web at http://localhost:8088  
* View metrics at http://localhost:3000

Using different docker-compose files
-----------------------
By default `docker-compose up` will run with `docker-compose.yml` in this folder.
This compose file is running with Cassandra, with basic visibility, 
using Prometheus for emitting metric, with Grafana access. 


We also provide several other compose files for different features/modes:

* docker-compose-es.yml enables advanced visibility with ElasticSearch 6.x
* docker-compose-es-v7.yml enables advanced visibility with ElasticSearch 7.x
* docker-compose-mysql.yml uses MySQL as persistence storage
* docker-compose-postgres.yml uses PostgreSQL as persistence storage
* docker-compose-statsd.yaml runs with Statsd+Graphite
* docker-compose-multiclusters.yaml runs with 2 cadence clusters

For example:
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-mysql.yml up
```

Also feel free to make your own to combine the above features.

Run canary and bench(load test)
-----------------------
After a local cadence server started, use the below command to run canary ro bench test
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-bench.yml up
``` 
and 
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-canary.yml up
``` 


Using a released image
-----------------------
The above compose files all using master image. It's taking the latest bits on the master branch of this repo.
You may want to use more stable version from our release process.

With every tagged release of the cadence server, there is also a corresponding
docker image that's uploaded to docker hub. In addition, the release will also
contain a **docker.tar.gz** file (docker-compose startup scripts). 

Go [here](https://github.com/uber/cadence/releases/latest) to download a latest **docker.tar.gz** 

Execute the following
commands to start a pre-built image along with all dependencies.

```
tar -xzvf docker.tar.gz
cd docker
docker-compose up
```

DIY: Building an image for any tag or branch
-----------------------------------------
Replace **YOUR_TAG** and **YOUR_CHECKOUT_BRANCH_OR_TAG** in the below command to build:
You can checkout a [release tag](https://github.com/uber/cadence/tags) (e.g. v0.21.3) or any branch you are interested.

```
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/uber/cadence
git checkout YOUR_CHECKOUT_BRANCH_OR_TAG 
docker build . -t ubercadence/<imageName>:YOUR_TAG
```

You can specify `--build-arg TARGET=<target>` to build different binaries.
There are three targets supported:
* server. Default target if not specified. This will build a regular server binary.
* auto-setup. The image will setup all the DB/ElasticSearch schema during startup.
* cli. This image is for [CLI](https://cadenceworkflow.io/docs/cli/). 

For example of auto-setup images:
```
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/uber/cadence
git checkout YOUR_CHECKOUT_BRANCH
docker build . -t ubercadence/server:YOUR_TAG-auto-setup --build-arg TARGET=auto-setup
```
Replace the tag of **image: ubercadence/server** to **YOUR_TAG** in docker-compose.yml .
Then stop service and remove all containers using the below commands.
```
docker-compose down
docker-compose up
```

DIY: Troubleshooting docker builds
----------------------------------

Note that Docker has been making changes to its build system, and the new system is currently missing some capabilities
that the old one had, and makes major changes to how you control it.
When searching for workarounds, make sure you are looking at modern answers, and consider specifically searching for
"buildkit" solutions.  
You can also disable buildkit explicitly with `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0 docker build ...`.

For output limiting (e.g. `[output clipped ...]` messages), or for anything that requires changing buildkit environment
variables or other options, start a new builder and use it to build with:
```
# create a new builder with your options
docker buildx create ...
# which will print out a name, use it in the build step.

# now use the exact same command as normal, but it prepends `buildx` and adds a builder flag.
docker buildx build . -t ubercadence/<imageName>:YOUR_TAG --builder <that_builder_name>
```

For output limiting (e.g. `[output clipped ...]` messages), you can fix this with some buildkit env variables:
```
docker buildx create --driver-opt env.BUILDKIT_STEP_LOG_MAX_SIZE=-1 --driver-opt env.BUILDKIT_STEP_LOG_MAX_SPEED=-1
```

DIY: Running a custom cadence server locally alongside cadence requirements
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you want to test out a custom-built cadence server, while running all the normal cadence dependencies, there's a simple workflow to do that:

Make your cadence server changes and build using "make bins". Then start everything, stop cadence server, and run your own cadence-server:
```
docker-compose up
docker stop docker-cadence-1
./cadence-server start
```

Using docker image for production
=========================
In a typical production setting, dependencies (cassandra / statsd server) are
managed / started independently of the cadence-server. To use the container in
a production setting, use the following docker command:

```
docker run -e CASSANDRA_SEEDS=10.x.x.x                  -- csv of cassandra server ipaddrs
    -e CASSANDRA_USER=<username>                        -- Cassandra username
    -e CASSANDRA_PASSWORD=<password>                    -- Cassandra password
    -e KEYSPACE=<keyspace>                              -- Cassandra keyspace
    -e VISIBILITY_KEYSPACE=<visibility_keyspace>        -- Cassandra visibility keyspace, if using basic visibility 
    -e KAFKA_SEEDS=10.x.x.x                             -- Kafka broker seed, if using ElasticSearch + Kafka for advanced visibility feature
    -e CASSANDRA_PROTO_VERSION=<protocol_version>       -- Cassandra protocol version
    -e ES_SEEDS=10.x.x.x                                -- ElasticSearch seed , if using ElasticSearch + Kafka for advanced visibility feature
    -e RINGPOP_SEEDS=10.x.x.x,10.x.x.x                  -- csv of ipaddrs for gossip bootstrap
    -e STATSD_ENDPOINT=10.x.x.x:8125                    -- statsd server endpoint
    -e NUM_HISTORY_SHARDS=1024                          -- Number of history shards
    -e SERVICES=history,matching                        -- Spinup only the provided services, separated by commas, options are frontend,history,matching and worker
    -e LOG_LEVEL=debug,info                             -- Logging level
    -e DYNAMIC_CONFIG_FILE_PATH=<dynamic_config_file>   -- Dynamic config file to be watched, default to /etc/cadence/config/dynamicconfig/development.yaml, but you can choose /etc/cadence/config/dynamicconfig/development_es.yaml if using ElasticSearch
    ubercadence/server:<tag>
```
Note that each env variable has a default value, so you don't have to specify it if the default works for you. 
For more options to configure the docker, please refer to `config_template.yaml`.

For `<tag>`, use `auto-setup` images only for first initial setup, and use regular ones for production deployment. See the above explanation about `auto-setup`. 

When upgrading, follow the release instrusctions if version upgrades require some configuration or schema changes.
