# CI/CD and Deployment

Implementing CI/CD pipelines and deployment of applications to containers or virtual or physical machines is a non trivial process.
Its business logic has to deal with complex requirements around rolling upgrades, canary deployments and rollbacks.
Cadence is a perfect platform for building a deployment solution as it provides all the necessary guarantees and abstractions
allowing developers focusing on the business logic.

Example production systems:

* Uber internal deployment infrastructure
* Update push to IoT devices
