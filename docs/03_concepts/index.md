# Concepts

Cadence is a new developer friendly way to develop distributed applications.

It borrows the core terminology from the workflow-automation space. So its concepts include [workflows](01_workflows) and [activities](02_activities). Workflows can react to [events](04_events) and return internal state through [queries](05_queries).

The [deployment topology](06_topology) explains how all these concepts are mapped to deployable software components.
